**ACM International Conference on Systems and Software Product Line Conference**

The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) provides a forum for practitioners, researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent ideas, innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in systems and software product lines and systems and software product family engineering. Conference events include opportunities to hear industry leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas, and to learn from both.

The SPLC is an international collaboration that has resulted from the merger of two former events: SPLC (which started in 2000 in the USA) and Product Family Engineering (PFE, which started in 1996 in Europe). The SPLC steering committee leads three SPLCs: SPLC-Europe (formerly PFE), sponsored by ESI; SPLC-Americas, sponsored by the SEI; and SPLC-Asia, sponsored by the Korea Software Institute.
